# NoPrivateSupport
MyBB plugin to show an explanation to low-post users trying to write emails or PMs.

The message is only displayed if the user is either logged in and has no permission to write mail, or when the user tries to write a PM and is in a group that can use the PM system, but cannot write PMs.  
If any of the above conditions are not met, the user is either allowed to send mail and/or write PMs, or they will see the default "no permission" page.  
You can customise the message in the language files if necessary.
